Scientifc calculator usage guide:

Operators basic arthimatic ('+' , '-' ,'*' , '/')

Operators are important- NEED to mention operators even if you use "ANS","PI" OR "eulers const" ,.. with numbers in your calculation.
Failure to do this will create  "Error!".

	x! = factorial (where x is const or variable)

	pi = the value of pi

	e = eulers const

	xy= exponent operator 

	log = base 10 logrithm


	trig functions:
		cos
		sin
		tan
		acos
		asin
		atan
		 
	--must follow by a const/expression and close closed parenthesis ")" NEEDED --
 <br>
 
Syntax

	-every open parenthesis "("  NEED to be finished with closed parenthesis ")"
	-- failure to do this will create  "Error!" --

	- operators ('!' '%') should be placed to the right of the value -

	- if there was any Syntax Error will show "Error!" as an output -

	- "ANS" will save the  value of your previous calculation -
	
	- you can use this  value for the next execution -

	-equlility operator('='):
		-- it will execute your equation --

<br>

### Quick start
- `clone this project`
- `npm run build` to build the project (at least the first time)
- `npm run serve-web` to preview in the browser at http://localhost:8000/index.web.html or http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/index.web.html with webpack-dev-server and hot reload enabled

Congratulations! You've just successfully run the project as a Website App.
